# http-net &mdash; Engineering Directives

> Engineering standards and the definition of done for this project. Read alongside `REPS.md` (root, authoritative) and `dev/ROADMAP.md` (current phase). If anything here conflicts with `REPS.md`, `REPS.md` wins.
> LexerSketch plan: `C:/Dev/libraries/Rust/lang-collection/_lexersketch/` (README rules of engagement, ARCHITECTURE, ISSUES, ROADMAP).

## 0. Philosophy

This library is built and maintained to a production standard and treated as a flagship piece of work. Plan the full path, then build one verified step at a time. "Good enough" is treated as a defect. It is a member of the owner's `-net` network domain in net-collection. LexerSketch Studio (specs/STUDIO.md, decision D23/D24) is its first consumer.

---

## 1. What this is

http-net owns HTTP/1.1 message syntax, framing, and connection state for servers and clients. It does not do TLS, routing frameworks, or async runtimes.

LexerSketch Studio's local server and the publish step's HTTPS client both need HTTP, and the portfolio rule is no rented runtime crates.

---

## 2. Engineering law (non-negotiable)

- **Ours, not rented.** No third-party runtime dependency. First-party `-lang` crates only, wired when first used. Dev-only test tooling is allowed.
- **Performance.** Peak is the baseline: allocation-free hot paths where feasible, dense ids instead of maps, no "faster" claim without `criterion` numbers at realistic scale (100k+ items).
- **Correctness.** Every invariant in section 4 is covered by property tests, cross-checked against a simple reference implementation wherever one can be written.
- **Hostile-input hardening.** Any input this crate accepts may be adversarial: explicit budgets (depth, size, steps), iterative algorithms, no quadratic paths, no reachable panics.
- **Architecture.** SOLID, KISS, YAGNI; one responsibility; a Tier-1 one-call entry point headlines the docs.
- **Cross-platform.** Linux, macOS, and Windows are first-class, verified by CI on stable and MSRV 1.85.
- **Error handling.** Every fallible path returns `Result`/`Option` per a documented contract; errors are `#[non_exhaustive]` and actionable.
- **Production-ready.** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and `#![deny(missing_docs)]` from the first commit; no `unwrap`/`expect`/`todo!`/`dbg!`/printing in library code; every public item has rustdoc with a runnable example; every claim in the docs maps to a test.

## 3. Definition of done

1. Compiles clean on Linux/macOS/Windows, stable and MSRV 1.85.
2. `fmt`, `clippy -D warnings` (all targets, all/no-default features), `test --all-features`, `cargo doc -D warnings` clean.
3. `cargo audit` + `cargo deny check` pass.
4. No `unwrap`/`expect`/`todo!`/`dbg!` in shipping code.
5. A Tier-1 API exists and headlines the docs.
6. Property tests cover every section-4 invariant; a fuzz target exists for every decoder or parser.
7. Hot-path changes carry benchmarks; no regression over 5%.
8. `README.md`, `docs/API.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` updated; the matching `docs/release/vX.Y.Z.md` written before the tag.
9. v1.0.0 only after a real consumer has exercised the API end to end (LexerSketch decision D18).

---

## 4. Project-specific invariants

- Parsing follows RFC 9112 strictly; malformed messages are rejected with precise errors, never guessed at.
- Header count, header size, line length, and body size are bounded before allocation; nothing panics on hostile input.
- Request smuggling vectors (conflicting Content-Length / Transfer-Encoding, obs-fold, bare CR) are refused.
